   * Version 3.3.8
        o *** compiles with gcc 3.2.2 ***
        o use namespace std as appropriate
        o using a local copy of pstream from sourceForge instead of ipfstream
        o including cstdio, cstdlib, ctime instead of stdio.h, stdlib.h, time.h
        o including iostream, sstream, fstream instead of stream.h, 
          strstream.h, fstream.h 
        o removing use of "dec" and using a private version (convert2string)
	o modify BossLabellerProcess to read from a pipe with "1-char" buffer
	o protect against failures of getuid()
        o scheduler registration examples in sched_examples use "-topwdir ."
        o working directories are BossJob_<jobid> instead of <jobid> only
        o BOSS archive file is removed at end of execution to allow job restart
        o Add printout in BossLabellerProcess
        o using classad 0.9.5 recompiled from source at installation time

   * Version 3.3.7
        o  support for binary distribution:
           - Configuration file is $BOSSDIR/CossConfig.clad
             and is in ClassAd format (not a shell script as before)
           - MySQL contact information are not hardcoded in the executables
             but stored in the configuration file $BOSSDIR/BossConfig.clad
           - boss executables look for the BossConfig.clad file in:
             1) the local directory
             2) the home directory
             3) the $BOSSDIR directory
             A copy of BossConfig.clad is stored in the job archive at
             submission time and thus is available in a grid environment
           - PLEASE NOTE THAT MYSQL PASSWORD ARE VISIBLE IN BossConfig.clad
        o installation instructions in 00INSTALL

   * Version 3.3.6
        o  added BossAttr attribute in classad file to allow job specific 
           information to be set at submission time. See jobtest/test.clad
           for an example.
   * Version 3.3.5
        o  fix bug in pbs_submit.pl example
        o  include pbs examples from RAL
        o  fix bug in use of InnoDB tables
        o  use quotes around variables in SQL commands (fixes problem using
           hostnames with dashes
        o  install MySQL 4.0.12 instead of 3.23.49
        o  jobExecutor prints a message to the log file at the beginning
           of the execution to help tracing problems
   * Version 3.3.4
        o  dbUpdator is killed BOSS_UPD_INTERVAL*BOSS_MAX_RETRY seconds
           after post-process finishes (if it doesn't exit before)
        o  dbUpdator is also used if found in the same directory of jobExecutor
           even if not in the path of the running process
        o  protect against disappearence of stdin/out/err files during 
           processing
        o  allow removal of registered jobtype filters (using SKIP)
   * Version 3.3
        o  name of the BOSS wrapper changed from jobExecuter to jobExecutor
        o  journaling: a file BossJournal_<BOSSID>.txt is created in the 
           working directory. "bss recoverJob -journal <journalfile>" fills 
           the DB with the info of the journal
        o  not all the filter scripts need to be registered to boss. If one 
           is missing simply that filtering step is not executed. This is 
           useful if one wants to run only post-processing and not runtime 
           processing.
        o  If runtime DB updating is not wanted it is enough not to compile 
           the dbUpdator executable (or delete it from the bin directory). 
           jobExecutor will run writing the journal and will not complain.
        o  all relevant files needed at runtime (e.g. filters) are extracted 
           frm the DB at submission time and packed in a file 
           BossArchive_<BOSSID>.tgz  which is unpacked at the time the job 
           starts
        o  the top_working_directory is passed as argument to jobExecutor (and
           to the submit script) instead of being read from the DB at runtime. 
           The submit scripts in sched_examples have been updated accordingly 
           THE SUBMIT SCRITPS ARE NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE!!!
        o  as a consequence of all these changes the job can start on the 
           execution host even if the MySQL server is down.
        o  the registerScheduler and registerJob may be executed on 
           schedulers/jobtypes already registered with fewer arguments. In 
           this case the missing fileds keep the old value
        o  added boss deleteScheduler and boss deleteJobType commands
        o  boss query is more robust against jobs with missing scheduler or 
           missing specific tables (e.g. after a boss deleteJobType)
        o  In case a job has multiple types and the same variable (i.e. column
           name) is present in more than one, only the correct table is updated
           (previously all instances of variables with the same name were
           updated everytime one had to be updated).
        THE DATABASE TABLES ARE BACKWARD COMPATIBLE since version 2.2.1

   * Version 3.2
        o boss registerJobType on an existing job type doesn't delete the 
          MySQL table if the -schema option is not used
        o Runtime updates are done at fixed intervals
        o New option -statusOnly for boss query command
        o Fixed bug in MySQL access during initialization 
          (with non-default port or socket)
        o Use of InnoDB instead of MyISAM in MySQL is possible.
          The MySQL server shipped with boss DOESN'T support InnoDB
        o New boss declare command (and boss submit -jobid option)
          for two-steps submission 
   * Version 3.1
        o Internal test release. Not distributed
   * Version 3.0
        o All temporary files go to $BOSS_TMP_DIR which is a configurable
          directory name.
        o Job submission through a job description file based on the ClassAd
          sintax
        o Support for submission of jobs to EU-DataGrid software.
          ${BOSSDIR}/MySQLGridConfig.sql files configures MySQL server to
          grant access from any site.
        o Support for multiple job-types for a single job. Use
          boss submit -jobtype type1,type2 ...
        o STDERR is parsed also at runtime (not only at post-process stage)
   * Version 2.1.1
        o Try reconnection to MySQL server on "Lost connection" errors
        o Allow the use of environmental variables to define boss top

        o Cleanup of tests in src directory
        o New executable jobGridExecuteri assumes user executable and
          stdin/out/err files in the current working directory (currently
          used for tests with grid schedulers)
   * Version 2.0
        o MySQL client part shipped with BOSS
        o Static compilation of executables
        o Removal of archive/ directory: scripts are stored in the database
        o Added the SUBMIT_BIN, KILL_BIN, QUERY_BIN in SCHEDULER table
        o Added the PRE_BIN, RUN_BIN, POST_BIN in JOBTYPE table
        o Change in the interface of the submission scripts
        o Log level in the BOSS log file selectable by switches in the
          Makefile
        o Removal of the S_ENV column in JOB table

        o User job standard error is parsed using the postprocess script at
          end of execution
