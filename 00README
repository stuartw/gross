A simple run through submitting an analysis of an entire dataset to LCG
A more complete example is shown in the user guide

a) Set environent	

	1)	ensure scram tool is available and in $PATH

	2)	do eval `scram runtiem -sh` in your ORCA directory

	3)	ensure edg software available - if at CERN source /afs/cern.ch/cms/LCG/LCG-2/UI/cms_ui_env.sh

	4)	source $GROSSDIR/grossenv.<sh|csh>

b) Edit Gross confgiuration file

	1)	sample file  $GROSSDIR/example/OrcaG.jdl
	
	2)	edit apropriate analysis fields
			- Executable (just name - location and version taken from scram environment)
			- Owner + Dataset + Datachain
			- Orcarc (full path)
			- OutputSandbox - your output files ie .root files
			- RunsPerJob - how many runs to analyse in each job of the task

	3)	edit appropraite scheduler options - grid options or local scheduler options
			- For grid:
				Requirements - for site matching - ie queue time limit
				RBconfig options - tell edg which broker and VO to use - not needed if on lxplus
			- For local:
				Scram - full path to scram executable ie. /afs/cern.ch/cms/utils/scram
c) Run Gross
	
	1)	submit an analysis of an entire dataset to LCG
			- gross 1 -userSpec <location of gross jdl file> -outputDir <location output should be saved to>

	2)	submit an analysis of a few runs to LCG
			- gross 1 -userSpec <location of gross jdl file> -outputDir <location output should be saved to> -jobId 1-5
	
	3)	submit an analysis of an entire dataset to LSF - note the fields  -type and -bossSched
			- gross 1 -type OrcaLoc -bossSched lsf -userSpec <location of gross jdl file> -outputDir <location output should be saved to>
