Changes for version 0.9.5: 
* Fixed a bug in printing parenthesized expressions with minimal
  parentheses. (It used to print garbage in some cases.)

* Identifiers can be quoted with almost anything between the
  quotes. This means you can have a ClassAd like:

  [
    A = 3;
   'B' = 4;
   'C&* X"' = 5; 
  ]

Unquoted identifiers must still begin with an alphabetic character or
underscore and be followed by alpanumeric characters or underscores. 

* Time representation has changed. Absolute times are represented in
  ISO8601 format. Absolute and relative times looks like function
  calls now:

  [
     birthday = abstime("1972-02-23:08:04:13-0600");
     jobtime  = reltime("2+13:15:36"); 
  ]

  The relative time is days + hours : minutes : seconds. See the
  online manual for more details. 

* The XML output is different in the following ways:

  - The <n> (number) tag has been replaced by <i> (integer) and <r>
    (real) tags. Real numbers are always represented as described
    below.

  - <at> is now absolute time, and <rt> is relative time. Between the
    tags, they are identical to the above representation. 

* Real number representation has been changed a bit. When real numbers
  are printed, they are printed with a fixed number of digits of
  precision. They look like: 4.500000000000000E+00. If you need to
  refer to "not a number", infinity, or negative infinity, you can do
  it like:

     nan               = real("NaN");
     infinity          = real("INF");
     negative_infinity = real("-INF");

* We now compile on gcc 3.2.x and 3.3.x, in addition to other versions
  of gcc.

* Various bug fixes, particularly in the XML output.

* ClassAd::MakeClassAd is now static (it's a factory method) and now
  works. It didn't work before. 

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

Changes for version 0.9.4: (release 21-Nov-2002)
* Added user-defined functions

* New parsing functions to allow input from different input types: C
  and C++ strings, streams, and files.

* Fixed some parsing bugs that could cause segfaults.

* Fixed a bug in evaluating function calls that could cause sefaults.

* Fixed bug in XML parsing that could cause problems for parsing empty
  strings, like <s></s>.

* Fixed error in evaluating lists. 

Changes for version 0.9.3: (released 1-Aug-2002)
* Made the standalone library compile with gcc 2.95.3, 2.96, and
  3.0.x. 

* You can define WANT_NAMESPACES, and the ClassAd library will be
  defined within the "classad" namespace now.

* Fixed a bug in views that could cause view members to be
  inadvertently erased. (bool ViewMemberLT::operator() was incorrect.)

* The ClassAd functions member and ismember switched the order of 
  parameters, and now match the documentation: the list argument
  is now second.

* bool EvaluateAttr(const string& attrName, Value &result) was declared
  in classad.h, but not defined. It now is. 

* Made IsStringValue() a bit safer in value.h

* There is a simple << operator for ClassAds now.

* New STL-like iterators for ClassAds and Collections. 

Changes for version 0.9.2: (released 12-Feb-2002)
* Setting the view info no longer loses the view name or parent
  view name.
* There is now a configure script to assist with building.

Changes for version 0.9.1:
* Fixed usage of va_end in debug.C
* Removed token after #endif
* Flushing of ClassAd collection logs was accidentally turned off, and
  is now turned back on.
* Fixed bug in ClassAd::Copy() where the parent scope wasn't being set
  properly.
