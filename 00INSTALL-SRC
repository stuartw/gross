*** Tested with gcc 3.2.2 ***
Assumes BOSS already installed
See BOSS documentation if this is not the case.

** GROSS/BOSS must be compiled on a Redhat 7 system - not RHEL3/SLC3, doing so results in the user being unable to run on RedHat 7 systems,
   ie. the majority of LCG2 sites. Also gcc3.2 must be available to get this either 
     - compile on a computer with the edg software available - at cern do /afs/cern.ch/cms/LCG/LCG-2/UI/cms_ui_env.sh
     - do `scram runtime -sh` in your ORCA/src directory

execute "make config" 
        --> creates the configuration files

execute "make"
        --> builds libraries and binaries and configures the database
	--> The BOSS database must be correctly configured before this command is run
        --> If the Gross databse is not correctly configured run "gross configureDB"

execute "source grossenv.csh" or ". grossenv.sh" 
        --> sets the environment

execute "cd grossjob; ./registerGrossJob" 
        --> register the "fork" scheduler


Note that BossConfig.clad is dynamically loaded at each command execution.
